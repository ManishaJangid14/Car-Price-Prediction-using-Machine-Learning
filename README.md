## Car-Price-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning  
### Overview  
The Cars Price Prediction project involves predicting the price of used cars based on various car specifications using statistical and machine learning techniques. By analyzing historical data of cars, we aim to build an effective model that can predict car prices based on key features given in the data.   
### Objective  
The goal of this project is to:    
- Perform data exploration to understand the dataset's structure and feature distributions.  
- Use data visualization techniques to identify patterns and relationships between car attributes (features) and price.  
- Develop machine learning models to predict the price of cars using various regression algorithms.  
- Evaluate the performance of the models and fine-tune them for better accuracy.  
  
### Project Workflow  
The project follows the typical data science workflow with the following steps:   

**1. Data Exploration**  
- Load and clean the dataset.  
- Handle missing values, duplicates, and outliers.  
- Explore the structure of the data and relationships between features.  
- Summary statistics and correlation analysis to identify key relationships with car prices.
  
**2. Data Visualization**  
- Plot histograms, bar charts, scatter plots, and box plots to understand data distributions and trends.
- Use correlation heatmaps to examine relationships between numerical features.
- Visualize price distributions across car brands, models, and other categorical variables to identify patterns.
  
**3. Data Preprocessing**  
- Encoding categorical variables to convert them into numerical features.
- Feature scaling (normalization or standardization) for numerical features such as mileage, engine capacity, etc.
- Feature selection techniques to identify the most influential variables for price prediction.
  
**4. Model Development**  
- Split the data into training and test sets for model evaluation.  
- Develop regression models such as:    
Linear Regression: To establish a baseline performance.  
Ridge/Lasso Regression: For regularization and feature selection.  
Decision Tree Regression: For non-linear relationships.  
Random Forest Regression: For ensemble learning and feature importance.

**5. Model Evaluation**  
Use cross-validation to tune model hyperparameters and avoid overfitting.  
Evaluate models using metrics such as:  
RÂ² (Coefficient of Determination): To explain variance.  
Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): To penalize larger errors.  
Compare different models and select the best-performing one. 

**6. Model Optimization**  
Perform hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV.  
Improve the model by tuning learning rate, tree depth, regularization terms, etc.  
  
Test the model on unseen data to assess its generalization performance.
