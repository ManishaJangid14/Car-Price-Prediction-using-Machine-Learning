### Car-Price-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
#### Overview
The Cars Price Prediction project involves predicting the price of used cars based on various car specifications using statistical and machine learning techniques. By analyzing historical data of cars, we aim to build an effective model that can predict car prices based on key features given in the data.   
### Objective
The goal of this project is to:  
- Perform data exploration to understand the dataset's structure and feature distributions.
- Use data visualization techniques to identify patterns and relationships between car attributes (features) and price.
- Develop machine learning models to predict the price of cars using various regression algorithms.
- Evaluate the performance of the models and fine-tune them for better accuracy.
